## Resources

### Map Framework
The Arathia world map leverages the capabilities of [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), a robust and open-source JavaScript library designed for the development of interactive maps. Leaflet's user-friendly interface and versatile nature make it an ideal choice for presenting geographical data with ease.

### Layer and Search Plugins
To enhance the map's functionality, we utilize additional plugins:
- **Grouped Layer Control**: The [Grouped Layer Control plugin](https://github.com/ismyrnow/leaflet-groupedlayercontrol) is integrated to manage multiple layers on the map efficiently, allowing users to easily switch between different types of information displayed.
- **Search Functionality**: The map's search feature is powered by the [Leaflet Search plugin](https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search), providing a seamless experience in locating specific markers or regions on the map.

### Marker Management with JSON
- **JSON Storage**: All markers are stored in a `.json` file, which acts as a central repository for marker data. This includes information about each marker's location, icon, title, and other relevant details.
- **Export and Import Features**: Users have the capability to export and import markers directly on the website. This feature enhances the ease of updating and managing the map's content:
   - **Export**: Users can export the current state of markers on the map into a JSON file. This file can then be edited or used as a backup.
   - **Import**: The import functionality allows users to upload a JSON file to add or update markers on the map. This process simplifies the addition of new markers and updates to existing ones.
- **Simplified Marker Creation**: The integration of JSON for marker management streamlines the process of adding new markers. Users can create markers by updating the JSON file and importing it, making it straightforward to keep the map's content current and accurate.

### Base Maps
The base maps for Arathia and Morturia were created using [Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net/) using custom icons.

### Development Tools
- **[Leaflet:](https://leafletjs.com/)** An open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.
- **[Wonderdraft:](https://www.wonderdraft.net/)** Used for making the base map.
- **[GitHub Pages:](https://pages.github.com/)** Used for hosting the interactive map.
- **[TiddlyWiki:](https://tiddlywiki.com/)** A unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.
